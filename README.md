Tips:
1. The board for the 3D printer is the RAMBo v1.4 See specs here:
   https://reprap.org/wiki/Rambo_v1.4
   
2. Use Repetier-Firmware Configuration Tool to change the repetier firmware:
   https://www.repetier.com/firmware/v092/
   
3. Pronterface.exe is a frontend software used for testing the printer:

4. Repetier-Host is the preferred frontend software:
